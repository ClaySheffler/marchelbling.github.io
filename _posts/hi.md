As a really very visionary man, I am starting this blog as I believe someday, people will have blogs.
Anyway, the purpose of this is not clearly defined as I sometimes wish to log some software stuff I found
interesting but also some food recipe or gardening discoveries.

The blog is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator and the design was very inspired by <a href="http://alexpearce.me>Alex Pearce</a>'s blog. You can check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/mrchlblng/mrchlblng.github.io).
