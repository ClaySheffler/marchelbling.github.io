I call myself a software engineer. I defended a Ph.D thesis entitled [Virtual sculpture using particles system](http://www.theses.fr/2010ISAM0030) and I took part [in](http://capitainetrain.com) [some](http://tinyclues.com) [startups](http://sketchfab.com) in Paris, France.

These pages are currently built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the design was inspired *cough* a lot by [Alex Pearce](http://alexpearce.me)'s blog. You can check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/mrchlblng/mrchlblng.github.io).
