As a really very visionary man, I am starting this blog since I believe that, someday, people will read & write blogs. Call me crazy if it pleases you!

And if you land on this page, you might want some details about me. I call myself a software engineer. I defended a PhD thesis entitled [Virtual sculpture using particles system](http://www.theses.fr/2010ISAM0030) and I took part in [some](http://tinyclues.com) [startups](http://capitainetrain.com) in Paris, France.

My current interests are mainly: (indie) music, baby education with a [bull terrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Terrier), tomatoes & [burrata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata), contemplation and balcony food gardening. Oh and software.

The blog is currently built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator and the design was inspired *a lot* by [Alex Pearce](http://alexpearce.me)'s blog. You can check out the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/mrchlblng/mrchlblng.github.io).
